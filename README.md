# Queens-Problem-
 ## Project Description
 We created a Python program that solves the "N-Queens Problem" - the problem of finding the number of valid solutions for placing n queens on an n x n sized board - using Hill Climbing, for any number of queens given.
 We could use any algorithm taught in our lesson "Artificial Inteligence" (ex. genetic algorithm, hill climbing, beam search).
